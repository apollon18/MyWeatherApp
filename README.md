# MyWeatherApp

Technical Assessment - Native Application 

1. Project: Weather App
     
	 To help the world plan for the future, you decide to build a weather forecast application. The application should allow users to select a city and view a
	  5-day weather forecast for the selected city on their smartphone.


2. Minimal functionality
	
	• The user must be able to search, add and remove a city to the city list. The list should be persisted locally.
	• The user must be able to view the hourly weather forecast for each day. 
	

3. Deliverables

	• The project with the source code, resource files and any third-party libraries used. Preferably you can share a Git Repo with us hosted in GitHub, Bitbucket
	etc.
	• A short (1-2 pages) write up that explains your design choices
		- Why certain approaches were used, why others were not used, design patterns etc.
		- Why certain third-party libraries were used, if any
		- Anything extra you would have done given more time - Anything else you feel we should know


4. Additional information and suggestions

	• Keep in mind that what we look at foremost is your engineering and coding skills (clean, well-executed code). Equally important are best practice development 	techniques, good look and feel and usability (keep UI/UX in mind). And lastly your approach on solving problems.
	• When you develop the app only focus at the very last firmware and devices on the market.
	• You are free to include any additional feature that could showcase your skills, but you should first make sure that you have covered the minimum requirements.
	A well- engineered feature is always better than two mediocre ones.
